<h2>How Generative AI Models are Solving the Problem</h2>

Personalization: Traditional streaming apps offer a limited selection of music that is curated by humans. This can make it difficult to find music that you enjoy and that fits your mood, especially if you have niche or specific tastes.
Creativity: Traditional streaming apps allow you to listen to pre-existing music. However, the music that you want may not have been made yet, or it may not be made in enough quantity. This could be due to language, cultural, or time barriers. For example, you would not find many rock songs that are sung in multiple languages, or an 80s hip hop track with current country song vocals.
Originality: The music generated for you is unique in that it has not been listened to by anyone before. This means that you can experience something truly new and original, and you can be the first person to share it with the world.
